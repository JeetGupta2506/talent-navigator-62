      "question": "Can you describe your experience with deep learning frameworks?",
      "answer": "I've been working with TensorFlow for 5 years and PyTorch for 3 years. I prefer PyTorch for research and prototyping due to its dynamic computation graph, while I use TensorFlow for production deployments. I've built CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers for various tasks including computer vision and NLP."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle model deployment and monitoring in production?",
      "answer": "I use Docker to containerize models and deploy them on Kubernetes for scalability. For monitoring, I implement MLflow for experiment tracking and model versioning, along with Prometheus and Grafana for real-time performance metrics. I also set up A/B testing frameworks to compare model versions and establish alerts for model drift and performance degradation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Tell me about a challenging ML project you worked on.",
      "answer": "I led the development of a real-time object detection system for autonomous vehicles. The main challenge was achieving 30 FPS inference while maintaining 95% accuracy on edge devices with limited compute. I optimized the model architecture using MobileNet as a backbone, implemented TensorRT for GPU acceleration, and created efficient preprocessing pipelines. The system is now deployed in over 500 vehicles and has processed millions of frames reliably."
